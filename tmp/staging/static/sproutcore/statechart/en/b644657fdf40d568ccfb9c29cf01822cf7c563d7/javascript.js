    Called by the statechart to allow a state to try and handle the given event. If the
    event is handled by the state then YES is returned, otherwise NO.
    
    There is a particular order in how an event is handled by a state:
    
      1) Basic function whose name matches the event
      2) Registered event handler that is associated with an event represented as a string
      3) Registered event handler that is associated with events matching a regular expression
      4) The unknownEvent function
      
    Use of event handlers that are associated with events matching a regular expression may
    incur a performance hit, so they should be used sparingly.
    
    The unknownEvent function is only invoked if the state has it, otherwise it is skipped. Note that
    you should be careful when using unknownEvent since it can be either abused or cause unexpected

    state = SC.State.extend({
    
      // Will be invoked when a event named "foo" is sent to this state
      foo: function(event, sender, context) { ... }
    
    })
  
  }}}
  
  In some situations, it may be advantageous to use one method that can react to 
  multiple events instead of having multiple methods that essentially all do the
  same thing. In order to set a method to handle more than one event you use
  the handleEvents method which can be supplied a list of string and/or regular
  expressions. The following example demonstrates the use of handleEvents:
  
  {{{
  
    state = SC.State.extend({
    
      eventHandlerA: function(event, sender, context) {
      
      }.handleEvents('foo', 'bar'),
      
      eventHandlerB: function(event, sender, context) {
      
      }.handleEvents(/num\d/, 'decimal')
    
    })
  
  }}}
  
  Whenever events 'foo' and 'bar' are sent to the state, the method eventHandlerA
  will be invoked. When there is an event that matches the regular expression
  /num\d/ or the event is 'decimal' then eventHandlerB is invoked. In both 
  cases, the name of the event will be supplied to the event handler. 
  
  It should be noted that the use of regular expressions may impact performance
  since that statechart will not be able to fully optimize the event handling logic based
  on its use. Therefore the use of regular expression should be used sparingly. 
  
  @param {(String|RegExp)...} args

/**
  The statechart manager mixin allows an object to be a statechart. By becoming a statechart, the
  object can then be manage a set of its own states.

  This implemention of the statechart manager closely follows the concepts stated in D. Harel's
  original paper "Statecharts: A Visual Formalism For Complex Systems"
  (www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~harel/papers/Statecharts.pdf).

  The statechart allows for complex state heircharies by nesting states within states, and
  allows for state orthogonality based on the use of concurrent states.

  At minimum, a statechart must have one state: The root state. All other states in the statechart
  are a decendents (substates) of the root state.

  The following example shows how states are nested within a statechart:

    {{{

      MyApp.Statechart = SC.Object.extend(SC.StatechartManager, {

        rootState: SC.State.design({

          initialSubstate: 'stateA',

          stateA: SC.State.design({
            // ... can continue to nest further states
          }),

          stateB: SC.State.design({
            // ... can continue to nest further states
          })
        })

      })

    }}}

  Note how in the example above, the root state as an explicit initial substate to enter into. If no
  initial substate is provided, then the statechart will default to the the state's first substate.

  To provide your statechart with orthogonality, you use concurrent states. If you use concurrent states,
  then your statechart will have multiple current states. That is because each concurrent state represents an
  independent state structure from other concurrent states. The following example shows how to provide your
  statechart with concurrent states:

    {{{

      MyApp.Statechart = SC.Object.extend(SC.StatechartManager, {

        rootState: SC.State.design({

          substatesAreConcurrent: YES,

          stateA: SC.State.design({
            // ... can continue to nest further states
          }),

          stateB: SC.State.design({
            // ... can continue to nest further states
          })
        })

      })

    }}}

  Above, to indicate that a state's substates are concurrent, you just have to set the substatesAreConcurrent to
  YES. Once done, then stateA and stateB will be independent of each other and each will manage their
  own current substates. The root state will then have more then one current substate.

  Remember that a statechart can have a mixture of nested and concurrent states in order for you to
  create as complex of statecharts that suite your needs. Here is an example of a mixed state structure:

    {{{

      MyApp.Statechart = SC.Object.extend(SC.StatechartManager, {

        rootState: SC.State.design({

          initialSubstate: 'stateA',

          stateA: SC.State.design({

            substatesAreConcurrent: YES,

            stateM: SC.State.design({ ... })
            stateN: SC.State.design({ ... })
            stateO: SC.State.design({ ... })

          }),

          stateB: SC.State.design({

            initialSubstate: 'stateX',

            stateX: SC.State.design({ ... })
            stateY: SC.State.desgin({ ... })

          })
        })

      })

    }}}

  Depending on your needs, a statechart can have lots of states, which can become hard to manage all within
  one file. To modularize your states and make them easier to manage and maintain, you can plug-in states
  into other states. Let's say we are using the statechart in the last example above, and all the code is
  within one file. We could update the code and split the logic across two or more files like so:

    {{{
      ---- state_a.js

      MyApp.StateA = SC.State.extend({

        substatesAreConcurrent: YES,

        stateM: SC.State.design({ ... })
        stateN: SC.State.design({ ... })
        stateO: SC.State.design({ ... })

      });

      ---- state_b.js

      MyApp.StateB = SC.State.extend({

        substatesAreConcurrent: YES,

        stateM: SC.State.design({ ... })
        stateN: SC.State.design({ ... })
        stateO: SC.State.design({ ... })

      });

      ---- statechart.js

      MyApp.Statechart = SC.Object.extend(SC.StatechartManager, {

        rootState: SC.State.design({

          initialSubstate: 'stateA',

          stateA: SC.State.plugin('MyApp.stateA'),

          stateB: SC.State.plugin('MyApp.stateB')

        })

      })

    }}}

  Using state plug-in functionality is optional. If you use the plug-in feature you can break up your statechart
  into as many files as you see fit.
